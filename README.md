### setTimeout with a shorter delay
Most browsers don't support a delay shorter than 10 milliseconds, so by using some magic hack with `window.postMessage()`, you can get a shorter delay that can run around 50 times faster. On my page it makes the cursor run about twice as fast as `setTimeout(func, 0)` would.
