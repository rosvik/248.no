Oupsie doopsie! There seems to have been an explosion at our
banana factory, and our code monkeys are on strike. We've
asked the Twitter Fail Whale to step in and help us out, but
it's not answering any of our emails, and honestly, we're
not sure what to do.

Look, we're all out here working hard to make things better
in this world, but sometimes, despite our best efforts, we
need to treat every HTTP request as a new opportunity to
learn and grow.

Of course, it is quite possible that you mistyped the URL,
which is a common mistake anyone can make. So if that's the
case, there's no need to feel bad about it. Either way,
we're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you have a great
rest of your day :)
